# Encryptix_Taskno.3

This repository contains the completed tasks for my internship in Machine Learning at Encryptix. The tasks involved implementing various machine learning models and solving real-world problems. Below are the details of the tasks completed:

## Task 3: Credit Card Fraud Detection

**Objective:** Detect fraudulent credit card transactions.

**Details:**
- Collected and preprocessed credit card transaction data.
- Explored various features and their importance in detecting fraud.
- Implemented several machine learning models including logistic regression, decision trees, and random forests.
- Evaluated model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.
- Addressed class imbalance using techniques like oversampling and undersampling.
- Selected the best model and fine-tuned it for better performance.

**Files:**
- Contains the dataset used for the analysis.
- Jupyter notebook with data exploration, model building, and evaluation.
-  Saved models and other relevant files.

## Conclusion
All three tasks were successfully completed, demonstrating various aspects of machine learning such as data preprocessing, model implementation, evaluation, and fine-tuning. Each task provided a valuable learning experience and contributed to my skills and understanding in the field of machine learning.
